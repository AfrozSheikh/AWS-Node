Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud that you can use to run applications, host websites, or manage backend systems.
It works just like a virtual machine (VM) on your laptop ‚Äî but runs inside AWS‚Äôs global data centers.

The term ‚ÄúElastic‚Äù means you can instantly scale ‚Äî launch or terminate servers as your needs grow or shrink.

‚öôÔ∏è Main Components
Component	               Description
Instance	               The virtual machine (VM) running on AWS
AMI (Amazon Machine Image)  Pre-configured OS and software image (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)
Instance Type	            Defines hardware configuration ‚Äì CPU, RAM (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large)
EBS (Elastic Block Store)	Persistent storage attached to an EC2 instance (like a hard drive)
Security Group	            Acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic
Key Pair (.pem)         	Secure SSH credentials used to log in to your instance
Elastic IP	                Static public IP address for consistent remote access
VPC/Subnet	                The virtual network environment where your EC2 runs

üöÄ Key Features                       Use
Auto Scaling	                    Automatically adds or removes instances based on traffic or workload
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)     	Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances
CloudWatch	                        Monitors performance metrics like CPU usage and instance health
Snapshots & AMIs	                Create backups or launch new instances from existing configurations
EC2 Fleet / Launch Template        	Efficiently manage and deploy multiple instances at scale
